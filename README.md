# Hey, I'm Nick Reyno
I'm a front end web developer based out of southern Ontario. I'm currently available for hire and am enjoy developing in React, PHP/Wordpress, and Javascript (both ES6 and jQuery).
I'm looking forward to expanding my knowledge about Wordpress and plan to pursue the MERN stack afterwards!
